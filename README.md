# blockybird
TODO: sick screenshot here

blockybird implements flappy bird with pure web technologies so you can run it
in your browser. Since I was too lazy to implement graphics and used simple 
blocks it is called blocky bird.

## How to play?
TODO: live demo?
Download the repo and open index.html with your browser.

## Why another flappy bird clone?
I had a couple of hours free at school and the "great WIFI" of my school didn't
worked. So out of pure boredom I created this little game to entertain myself. 
I mean how long can it take to create flappy bird? 4 hours, it took little 
bit less than 4 hours.

I really don't know why you would even read till this section in the README,
